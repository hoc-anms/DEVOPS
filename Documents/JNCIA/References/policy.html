                <p>Candidates who fail their first attempt at an exam can retake it at any time. However, for any future
                    attempts, a candidate must wait a period of 14 calendar days, beginning the day after the failed
                    attempt, before they may retest for the same exam. Once the exam is passed, the candidate must wait
                    at least 18 months before retaking the exam, which would generally be for recertification purposes.
