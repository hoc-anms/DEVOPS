# JNCIS-DevOps

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks and other supporting files that accompany the Junos Genius cert prepations videos for JNCIS Automation and DevOps.

Jupyter notebooks allow rich text to be combined with programming language interpreters.  The results are local web pages which are great at demonstrating programming concepts.  As the JNCIS-DevOps course covers Python and other programming tools, these learning bytes use Jupyter notebooks in conjunction with the normal video content.

You can just view the videos or, if you’d prefer, you can download the notebooks and follow along with the course.  To download the files: go to downloads on the left hand side, then click on download repository.  This will download a zip file containing everything in the repository.  Once you have the notebooks downloaded you have reference code to refer back to as part of your exam preparation.  You are also free to copy the code and modify it for your own uses.

## Installation

To install, follow the instructions outlined here: http://jupyter.org/install

Then clone this repository or download the files into a local directory.  From that local directory simply run: 

```jupyter notebook``` 

This will then give access to the notebooks as demonstrated in the videos.  A browser window should spawn automatically to the local notebook URL.
If not browse to: http://localhost:8888/tree
